This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved.  It usually manifests as `undefined` or `null` being returned unexpectedly, potentially leading to crashes or incorrect application behavior.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value.someProperty); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')
});
```
